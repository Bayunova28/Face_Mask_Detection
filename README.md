Face mask detection involves detecting the location of the face and then determining whether it has a mask on it or not. The issue is proximate cognate to general object detection to detect the classes of objects. Face identification categorically deals with distinguishing a specific group of entities Face. It has numerous applications, such as autonomous driving, education, surveillance etc. In this project we are using a simplified approach to serve the above purpose using the basic Machine Learning (ML) packages such as TensorFlow, Keras and OpenCV.

Face Mask Detection Platform uses Artificial Network to recognize if a user is not wearing a mask.  The app can be connected to any existing or new IP mask detection cameras 
to detect people without a mask. App users can also add faces and phone numbers to send them an alert in case they are not wearing a mask. If the camera captures an unrecognized 
face, a notification can be sent out to the administrator.
